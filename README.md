# General Assembly - Project 4

## Overview

This was my final project, a complex full-stack application built with Django REST Framework and React.

Crumble is a Full-Stack dating app, which allows users to register and/or login, and find others who share the same interests.

#### The app has been deployed with Heroku and is available [here](https://github.com/adrianp2021/SEI-Project-4).

##  Brief and timeframe

* Build a full-stack application, by making your own front-end and back-end

* Use a Python Django API using Django REST Framework to serve your data from a Postgres database

* Consume your API with a separate front-end built with React

* Be a complete product which most likely means multiple relationships and CRUD functionality for at least a couple of models

* Be deployed online so it's publicly accessible

* Timeframe: 8 days
